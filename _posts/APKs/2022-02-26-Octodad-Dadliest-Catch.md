> _"Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about his life. Octodad's existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.younghorses.octodad" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Octodad was a game that was quite popular when it was greenlit by some YouTubers, and it reminded me a bit of some other games like Hand Simulator... <!--more-->Though when i played it for the first time with the APK, I was &lt;_got something to rush real quick, will update more soon_&gt;
