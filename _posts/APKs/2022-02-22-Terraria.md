This game is **incomparable**. This game stands out above every other game I have ever seen. Like, I don't even know where to start. Relogic kept on saying `"this is the last update"` in the last, like, **4** updates. The lead director, _Redigit_, felt that he was losing interest of the game, **_years ago_**. <!--more-->

I don't even need to explain this game, it can just explain in itself, and a whole community of gamers who love this game! As of this typing [_2022-Feb-27_], they're working on the **Labor of Love** update on PC after winning the Labor of Love award the last Steam Awards. However, they have prioritized **_Parity_** to come before that, which means DR Studios are working to update the mobile and console version to have the _Don't Starve Together_ crossover content. Like, I can't believe it, after many years of playing this game in an out, and being around there for the mobile version ever since 1.2.1, before Lightning Boots came. 

> In fact, that first time I have ever played Terraria was actually from an APK. I wanted more of the game after realising I could not combine the _Anklet_, the _Aglet_ & the _Spectre Boots_. After that, I decided to buy the game. That (along with the PC version and several other games) was one of the **best video game purchases I have ever made**. - _Arif_

Shoutouts to <a href="https://www.drstudios.co.uk/" target="_blank">DR Studios</a> for doing such a great job porting 1.3 content to mobile, and also 1.4 content so much faster than the console version. I really aspire to be like them one day, more than just creating this sketchy website. Heck, uploading the paid APK gives a slight tinge of guilt, but I still upload for the _sake of backup_.
