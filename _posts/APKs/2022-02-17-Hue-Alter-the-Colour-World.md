Now what an interesting game. An awesome concept and an awesome execution.. <!--more--> In this <span style="color:#0CB4E5;">game</span>, you play as Hue, and if I am right, you're <span style="color:#2936F6;">collecting</span> pieces of a ring that will unlock your perception of colour in the world you live in. I've played into this game quite far on the _<span style="color:#AA07F6;">Steam</span> version_, so no doubt perhaps the _mobile version_ could probably emulate such immersive and extravagant gameplay. 

What really makes this game stands out <span style="color:#EE42A5;">compared</span> to other games like this is the **OST**, the **voice acting**, maybe even the **graphics**, but also especially the **unique colour <span style="color:#F61B21;">mechanism</span>** that makes use of your powers to change the colors of the world around you! It's pretty fun, ngl, the gameplay I have won't do this game <span style="color:#FB8E0B;">justice</span>, man.

Side note: for some reason, when I ran this on my <a href="/about-devices" target="_blank" style="color:FBCC0A;">J4</a>, the **walls**, **ceilings** and **floors** didn't show up, but it appeared on my A16 as shown in the <span style="color:#94EA0B;">gameplay</span>. <span style="font-size:80%;">You can even see me pause for half a second as I was surprised to see it work for the first time, even so recording it</span>
