Created by **Amaya Daisuke**, aka **Studio Pixel**, this game is quite an underrated **masterpiece**. This game, you're a frog janitor that shoots stuff (some cool bosses btw), your friends with other frogs and cats, that's pretty cool.<!--more--> To be frank, I never finished this game (as of 2022-02-15) but this game really brings out good gameplay, especially with its upgrades and among other things. Achievements also bring out a challenge, like the jacket one.

One thing I find **genius** about the android port is how the shooting "gear-shift-thingy" allows you to toggle shoot at any of the 3 directions, while **freeing your right thumb** to tap on the jump button as well. Props to whoever created it for mobile!
