> _"Discover the funniest multiplayer physics puzzle platformer! In Human: Fall Flat you play as a wobbly human who keeps dreaming about surreal places filled with puzzles where heâ€™s yet to find the exit. Exploration and creativity are key, as every option is welcome!" - <a href="https://505games.com/games/human-fall-flat/" target="_blank">505 Games</a>_

This game picked up speed at a constant pace about 4 years ago (gosh that's a while back), back when <a href="https://youtu.be/vKd5S5MxU-Y" target="_blank">Vanoss played it for the first time</a>, and looking at the title he liked it a lot probably.<!--more--> I was intrigued by this game, as it shows that you as the character has _control over their hands **individually (ambidexterous)**_. I found it hard to believe how a game with a **control scheme** like that would end up on mobile, and guess what, people don't like the controls for mobile! However, I for one, loves the controls, as I believe that is slightly the point of the game. It takes a while to figure it out but once you got it, playing through it in mobile would be quite a blast! <span style="font-size:80%;">Disclaimer: I only did the first 2 levels as of 2022-02-21</span>
