> _"Forager is an open world, adventure and exploration game inspired by The Legend of Zelda and more modern titles such as Terraria, Stardew Valley & Minecraft. Players will be able to buy lands to expand and explore a vast world filled with secrets, puzzles, friendly characters and foes. Craft interesting items, build (and defend!) their bases and learn powerful skills and abilities." - <a href="https://hopfrogsa.net/forager" target="_blank">Official Forager site</a>_

I saw this game a while back and mistaked this with Autonauts because both of them probably literally share the same colors for their grass. <!--more--> Playing this for the first time when testing the APK gave me a good impression of this game, i mean, the excerpt from the website says as it was inspired from some good games. I barely play through games entirely unless I really like them and have the time, Forager could be an exception if I want to keep playing it. I could tell this is a long term game though, so I'm in between this and quite a few others, and Terraria would take precedence in my playtime.
