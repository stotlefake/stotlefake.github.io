Tank Hero: Laser Wars, <!--more--> There's not much to this game besides nostalgia, the only criticism of this game i have is the controls for shooting. 

This game I enjoyed its weapons a lot, especially the Tesla one, and it also has awesome powerups, like shield (which is actually just invincibility), ricochet shots & more!
