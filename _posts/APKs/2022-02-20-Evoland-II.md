Aight, it's a good game, it's kinda like Evoland I but a different storyline (probably). I went quite far in this game but kinda lost interest. I clearly remember the game crashing a lot when I was using a **controller** on Android for a while, especially around where like you fight snowmen by doing Candy Crush or smtg.

unpopular opinion: this game is not remarkable
