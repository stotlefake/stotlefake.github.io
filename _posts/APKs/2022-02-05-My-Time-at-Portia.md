I like this game. Released not too long ago, you're character escapes city life for a life of adventure and building, kinda like Stardew Valley but more building than farming. <!--more-->

This is a **huge** game, the APK itself is **1.13 GB**, making it the biggest file so far. This a port(ia, lol geddit?) of its PC counterpart, and looking at the genres below, it sure has a _hard time_ on _lower spec phones_. To be frank, i never played as far as beyond getting the building license, but looking at the controls and the previews from retail, it seems like a game that I would quite enjoy. 

_Scan for this file is currently on-going.._
