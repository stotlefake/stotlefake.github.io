> _"You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home?" - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

This game right here, it was one that I missed out when the _hype_ was all around. Everything about this game was pretty fun, and it was **more than a farming simulator**, which was why I steered away from it initially.<!--more--> When I played this for the _first time_ on Steam Remote Play with, like, 2 other people, I picked up interest. As I played it though, I find such great _irony_, where the game was about going away from the stress of city life, while here I am, in a concrete house, playing *Stardew Valley* on my phone. I barely played this game yet, but the first 30min or less already had a great impression on me.
