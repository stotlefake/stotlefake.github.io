> _"In this white-knuckle cyberpunk first-person shooter, you are the last line of defense between an abominable mechanical army and the fate of the entire universe. A dark force has commandeered the weaponry and defenses of a space station and it has big plans to expand! There's no one else to save the day. You'll have to grab the nearest weapon and take the fight to the machines. Don't expect them to just roll over and become scrap metal, though. You'll have to contend with flying drones, powerful cannons, and more!" - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crescentmoongames.neonshadow" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Neon Shadow, a <span style="font-size:120%;">_Cyberpunk 3D First Person Shooter_</span>, created by <a href="https://www.crescentmoongames.com/" target="_blank">Crescent Moon Games</a>. This was quite the game! For it's time of release, it's graphics are pretty and **super optimized**, it ran pretty well on some crap phone I was using for when I played it for the first time back in probably 2016 or `17.<!--more--> It is also pretty reminiscent of Doom, where there was your character's face in the HUD and no jumping. I love that extra mile of how the HUD **moves as you move**, as shown in the gameplay above. If I recall, it was even free back then!

Ahhh, but what happened to this game?

Neon Shadow was bought by some company called GameClub Inc. aka E.A. Mini. This company was birthed by Jeff Bezos in his golden hospital after a monkey killed Jeffrey Epstein with an television and 37 toothpicks. After spitting in the doctor's face and stealing the coffee machine, GameClub decided to buy <span style="font-size:130%;">59 games in the Play Store, _including Neon Shadow_</span>. Like a seductress, **they made all the games free** (as it should, except, like, a few of the 59 games). <span style="font-size:120%;">Now one would say they're good guys to make all the games fre-</span> <span style="color:#0F0;font-size:180%;text-shadow:10px 10px 0 #00F, -10px -10px 0 #F00;">NOPE</span>, you must <span style="font-size:140%;">_sign in like pretentious dweeb_</span> with a <span class="rotate-180">GameClub account</span>, which is a <span class="despair">paid subscription</span>. GameClub's slogan should be changed from "a new way to <span class="lag-echo">play!</span>" to "a new way to <span class="lag-echo">pay!</span>"

<br>Aight, i'm done _entp_-ing, here below is the download. 

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>: One very important thing to do after installing is to go Neon Shadow's Google Play page, tap on the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i>, and de-check "Enable auto-update". I let my phone that game automatically once and it came back to the smooth brain GameClub version of the game where it forces me to get a GameClub subscription. <span style="font-size:60%;">to be fair, it does give a free 30-day trial</span> <span style="color:orange;">Disclaimer</span>: if it says that `"Download failed because you may not have purchased this app"`, then you pretty much can't play it. I was able to play it recently when I was signed in to my long-time email, but when I'm using a different alias email on a different phone, it showed that message. 

[2022-Feb-18] Here's a tip to get limitless 30-day trials, just use <a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/">Guerilla Mail</a>, in fact, here is some <a href="/static/images/1750-8205-30130.jpg" target="_blank">proof</a> from me, heheheheheheheheh. suckers.

Shoutouts to <a href="https://neon-shadow.en.uptodown.com/android" target="_blank">UpToDown</a> for having somewhat similar vision to our websites, I got my APK from them. The 1.38 version is the last version before GameClub dumped their load into the later versions
