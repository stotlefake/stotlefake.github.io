Aquaria. My sister showed me this when I was little, and as I watched her play, I realized that the **music of the game was the most extravagant I have ever heard**. <!--more-->Almost everything about the game was perfect (except the map system but it's still usable). The game was originally on PC, developed by [Derek Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Yu) & [Alec Holowka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Holowka), then it was made for subsequent platforms afterwards, then Android was last, thanks to [Andrew Church](https://achurch.org/) and was commercially released as part of Humble Bundle (couldn't find link to it). This game was amazing, it is unfortunate that the creators and enablers of this game abandoned it (even on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/24420/Aquaria/), absolutely no update from the developers). 

Currently, the APK that I have obtained is **functional**, and after much searching and help online, I was able to find a way to get deep inside the APK, especially the .dat file inside, by using Andrew's [SIL](https://achurch.org/SIL/) ([source]()). I won't say its optimal, especially since with phones that have higher screen ratios like my [current phone (at API 30)](https://arifhamed.github.io/about-devices) right now, the game is stuck at classic ratio. In my current phone, as shown above, it offers me to go **fullscreen**, which **ruins the input** because its inputs are more towards the left and **unnecessarily stretches it**, but in my J4, the older one, the game fits perfectly. iirc, the latter phone has a resolution of **1280x720**.

If the ratio seems messed up even if your phone should fit, go to your settings for your apps and force stop it, then run it again, it should fix itself, probably
