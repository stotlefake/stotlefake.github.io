> _"Tesla vs Lovecraft is an intense top-down twin stick arena shooter from the creators of Crimsonland and Neon Chrome. Play as the enigmatic inventor Nikola Tesla harnessing the static energy to power up Tesla-Mech and give the lovecraftian nightmares a lesson in horror!" - <a href="http://teslavslovecraft.com/" target="_blank">TvsL Official Site</a>_

This is the first twin-stick shooter in the catalog! <!--more--> First of all, game **smooth** as heck. Second of all, look at that **end-game gameplay** (in the other websites, especially in the TvsL Official Site)

I've only heard of this game towards last year, and i really liked the theme, the battle between _Nikola Tesla_ & _H.P. Lovecraft_. 2 themes clashing each other, so that battle really fits well in a game like this. If I would, I would play this game completely through, perhaps even do a recorded gameplay and _post it here_. 

To put it simply: 
* graphics _10/10_ (lightning go `ztzzt`)
* performance _10/10_
* tesla _100/10_
