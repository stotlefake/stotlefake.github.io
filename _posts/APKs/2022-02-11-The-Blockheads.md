The Blockheads, what a tragic history.

This is basically if Terraria was Diner Dash, and in 2.5D graphics. The things that make this game stand out is its whole survival system, where there is health, hunger, energy, _happiness_, amongst other things. Kinda nostalgic, I remember getting a jetpack in the game.<!--more-->

Now about what happened to this game. This was once in the Play Store, and the game had an in-game premium currency called time crystals. You can use it to make the game faster, like in crafting, sleeping, etc, except meditation, travel, mining & eating. That was the revenue for the game, but ever since its release, people have been finding ways to hack time crystals into their world/account, and just like that, after a long while, the devs removed it because there was just no more revenue coming from it. <br>As to why it exists in the App Store, they got different rules probably. The Amazon Store still has it but its outdated probably.

Now, according to the [Blockheads official forum](https://theblockheads.net/2018/03/15/1.7-out-now.html), the Noodlecake Studios (probably either the publisher or developer of Blockheads) still host it [here](https://noodlecake.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/theblockheads1.7.6.apk). However, for some damn reason, 1.7.6 doesn't start up on my current phone, but it does run on my API 27 phone, so I uploaded 1.7.5 version instead.
