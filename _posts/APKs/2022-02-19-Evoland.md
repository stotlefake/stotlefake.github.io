Yet another interesting concept game...

As one of my disclaimers has stated, this one applies to not actually playing much of the game. I actually played [Evoland II](https://arifhamed.github.io/APKs/Evoland-II) first <span style="font-size:70%;">as it was probably on sale</span>. They're kinda similar in my opinion, so let's just go there too.

If you just want this game though, all I can say about it is that this game is if **_Sonic Boom didn't suck_**, and there was **_no Sonic_**. Basically its an **RPG** that **utilizes almost all kinds of game genres**, except that it's alright, like they actually conducted real QC on this game <span style="font-size:70%;">i won't say much good for the Evoland II though</span>.
