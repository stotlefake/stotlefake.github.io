Tank Hero, a game born from Reddit, is a game where you play as a little green tank facing off other coloured tanks in many different arenas.<!--more--> There's not much to this game besides nostalgia, the only criticism of this game i have is the controls for shooting. The next instalment, <a href="https://arifhamed.github.io/APKs/Tank-Hero-Laser-Wars" target="_blank">Laser Wars</a>, is a great successor of this game
