# About my stuff
For all reviews and my current judgements, I decided to make things simpler for myself and list what are my devices right here.
### PC
* ~~Acer... i can't recall the model, but it was the worst~~
* Lenovo ThinkPad X250 ([specs](https://arifhamed.github.io/static/PDF/ThinkPad_X250_Spec.PDF))
* Lenovo Yoga C640-13IML ([specs](https://arifhamed.github.io/static/PDF/Yoga_C640_13IML_Spec.PDF))

### Android
* ~~one or two samsung phones that I have lost throughout, what humbling times...~~
* Samsung Galaxy J4 ([specs](https://www.google.com.sg/))
    * Attempted to root it as I unlocked the OEM bootloader already, but I currently lack motivation
	* Android API 27
* Oppo A16 ([specs](https://www.google.com.sg/))
    * Obtained in 2022 Jan 01
	* Android API 30

External storage wise... I do not see a reason why I should disclose (only because I cannot bother too), at least 2TB.
