# No one is self-made
I done a lot of things, whether be it for school or on my own time, and I learn a lot at the same time. Hence, roll the credits...
* [Github](https://pages.github.com/)
    * for hosting this website and making collaboration possible globally, and its allowance for Freedom of Information
* NYP
    * for teaching a lot of things, like, a lot. I have no regrets choosing this school (and the course)
* [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
    * for making itself available for anyone (even though I know whatever we upload is sold to bigger corporations, so uhhh ok)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), _egillespie_ 
    * for making knowledge available for markdown sites, such as from [this repo](https://github.com/egillespie/markdown-only-website)
